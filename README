Manage git packages and repositories.

If you want git installed:

    include git::packages

If you'd like to checkout a repo:

    git::checkout { "<whatever>":
        url    => "<repo path/url>",
        target => "<where the repo should land>",
        ref    => "<a tree-isn to checkout>",
        user   => "<user to own the checkout>",
        group  => "<group to own the checkout>",
        update => <true/false to keep the checkout up-to-date>
    }

Coming soon: `git::export`.
